    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These little croquettes stuffed with chicken and spices are popular snacks served in bars all over Brazil. The name means 'little chicken thigh' in Portuguese because of their shape</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>2 boneless skinless chicken breasts (300-350g)</li>
    <li>450g floury potatoes</li>
    <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
    <li>1 large onion</li>
    <li>4 tbsp Cabana spicy malagueta marinade</li>
    <li>100g plain flour</li>
    <li>2 eggs</li>
    <li>100g panko</li>
    <li>breadcrumbs</li>
    <li>vegetable oil</li>
    <li>Â½ small pack flat-leaf parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        
<li>Bring a pan of salted water to the boil, then reduce to a simmer. Poach the chicken very gently for 10 mins. Remove from the heat, cover and cook for 10-15 mins more until cooked through. Use a slotted spoon to remove the chicken and leave to cool. Reserve the poaching liquid.</li>

<li>Bring the liquid to the boil, add the potatoes and simmer for 15-20 mins until just tender. Drain, then leave to dry out before mashing and seasoning.</li>

<li>Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a pan, add the onion and stir over a medium-low heat for 8-10 mins. To assemble, shred the chicken in a bowl, mix in the mash, onions and marinade, then taste and season. With damp hands, shape about 50g of mixture into a teardrop shape. Set it upright on a plate and repeat with the rest of the mixture. Coat each in flour, egg and breadcrumbs. Cover with cling film and chill for at least 1 hr.</li>

<li>Heat the vegetable oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 170C or until a piece of bread browns in 30 secs. Fry in batches for 3-4 mins until golden, turning once or twice. Remove and drain on kitchen paper. Serve warm with the parsley scattered over.</li>
